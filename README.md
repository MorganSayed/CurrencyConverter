# CurrencyConverter
Assignment for my Programming I class. Web_Utility was already given to us, as well as outlines as to what functions to include.


Billâ€™s Budget Adventures, a tourist company, has asked you (an indie developer) to build a utility app that helps their customers figure out the cost of items in the countries they visit on a trip. Bill thinks the app should run on any mobile phone, laptop, or desktop computer, since his customers come from all over the world. But, he is happy for you to create a prototype of the app that runs on desktop only. He needs the app to always use the latest information about exchange rates for each of the tourist destinations.
